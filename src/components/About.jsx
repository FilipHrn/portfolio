      My name is Filip. I am 25 years old and a recent front-end development graduate. In summary, I learned about design principles, how different website elements are constructed both visually and logically, how the front-end technologies communicate with the back-end systems and how to use the three main languages of the web, namely HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, to develop stunning and practical websites.

      I think of my self as a positive and organized person. I am very easy to talk to and like working both individually and in teams. My short-term goal is to get hired as a front-end developer and my long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer.

      I thrive when around technology and I am ready to start my career as a developer!

      HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, SASS, NextJS, REST API, GraphQL

      Familiar with:
